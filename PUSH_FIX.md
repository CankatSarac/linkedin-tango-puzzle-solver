# Push the Vercel Fix to GitHub

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployment is failing because it can't see the latest commit with the fix.

## The Fix
The `vercel.json` file needs to be updated with this content:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "src/app/**/*.{js,ts,tsx}": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED": "1"
  }
}
```

## How to Apply
1. **Option A:** Run `git push origin main` in your terminal
2. **Option B:** Edit `vercel.json` directly on GitHub with the content above
3. **Option C:** Use GitHub Desktop to push the changes

## After Pushing
Once the fix is on GitHub, Vercel will automatically detect the new commit and should deploy successfully.
